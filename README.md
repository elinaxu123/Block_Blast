How to Run the Game:
    To run the game, install Pygame (pip install pygame), then execute block_blast_midterm.py. The game involves placing blocks on a grid to form full rows, which then clear for points.

How to Play the Game:
Objective:
-Place blocks onto the grid and clear full rows or columns to earn points.
-Keep playing as long as you can without blocking yourself or placing blocks in the top spawn area!

How to Play:
-A random block will appear at the top of the grid (in the dark gray "spawn zone").
-Move the block into the white play area below the red line.

Controls:
-Left Arrow (←): Move the block left.
-Right Arrow (→): Move the block right.
-Down Arrow (↓): Move the block down faster.
-Up Arrow (↑): Move the block upward (only below the red line).
-Enter/Return: Place the block permanently on the grid.(Only press enter once!)

Scoring:
-Clear a full row or column to earn 50 points.
-The more lines you clear, the higher your score!

Rules:
-You cannot place a block inside the dark gray "spawn zone."
-If you fill the spawn zone or there are no more spaces to place new blocks, the game ends.
-Watch out for gray obstacle blocks — they make the grid harder to clear!

Tip:
-Plan ahead! Some blocks are tricky shapes and can block you if you're not careful.
-Choose your grid size (small, medium, or large) wisely before starting the game.
